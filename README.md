# Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions. The model is trained using a dataset containing financial transactions and classifies them as either legitimate or fraudulent.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Model performance metrics visualization

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fraud_Detection.git
cd Fraud_Detection
```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Fraud_Detection.ipynb
```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is publicly available (e.g., Kaggle's credit card fraud detection dataset). Ensure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory before running the notebook.

## Model Training
The notebook covers:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection and scaling
- Training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluating performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score

## Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions, with performance metrics visualized in the notebook.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you have suggestions for improving the model.
